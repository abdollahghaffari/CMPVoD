# CMPVoD
## CMPVoD is an architecture for P2P video on demand streaming.It is simulated by OMNET++ 4.1.
### This is simulation code of CMPVoD. CMPVoD runs on OMNET++ 4.1. If you use upper versions of OMNET++, you need to change the code. CMPVoD needs to build inet (this is exists in the attached packages- add and built it). CMPVoD is simulation codes of the following papers:
### [1] An adaptive buffer-map exchange mechanism for pull-based peer-to-peer video-on-demand streaming systems
### [2] A free-riding resiliency incentive mechanism for VoD streaming over hybrid CDN-P2P networks
### [3] CMPVoD: A cluster mesh-based architecture for VoD streaming over hybrid CDN-P2P networks
### [4] A study on repeat-request chunks in pull-based peer-to-peer video-on-demand streaming
